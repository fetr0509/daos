#!/bin/bash
# A Script that runs a series of simple tests that
#  can be executed in the Jenkins environment.
#  The flock is to ensure that only one jenkins builder
#  runs the tests at a time, as the tests use the same
#  mount point.  For now, there actually isn't much
#  contention, however, because /mnt/daos on the jenkins nodes
#  is subdivided into /mnt/daos/el7; /mnt/daos/sles12sp3;
#  /mnt/daos/ubuntu1404; and /mnt/daos/ubuntu1604
#  These are mapped into /mnt/daos in the docker containers
#  for the corresponding Jenkins distro builder. This "magic"
#  is configured in the Jenkins config page for daos builders
#  in the "build" section.
#
#  Note: Uses .build_vars.sh to find daos artifacts
#  Note: New tests should return non-zero if there are any
#    failures.

#check for existence of /mnt/daos first:

    #     at the same time.
    # We use grep to filter out any potential "SUCCESS! NO TEST FAILURES"
    #    messages as daos_post_build.sh will look for this and mark the tests
    #    as passed, which we don't want as we need to check all of the tests
    #    before deciding this. Also, we intentionally leave off the last 'S'
    #    in that error message so that we don't guarantee printing that in
    #    every run's output, thereby making all tests here always pass.
